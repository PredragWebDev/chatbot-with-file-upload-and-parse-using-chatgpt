"Switching from sandals to boots is one of the few perks of the start of the cold-weather seasons. After all, cute closed-toe shoes means not having to worry about pedicures and come fall, we get to slip our toes into cozy and warm boots — which are oftentimes more supportive and comfortable than our go-to warm-weather shoes. If you're headed on a trip and need a new pair of comfy boots, check out the selection at Amazon. The retailer has some of the best names at the best prices ahead of the Prime Big Deal Days event, which kicks off on Tuesday, October 10.  "

"Lug sole shoes are definitely one of this fall's biggest footwear trends. Not only does the style have a cool combat boot-esque look, but it’s impressively practical since the thick sole is supportive and adds some inches to your height. These Chelsea ankle boots from Soda have a timelessness to them, plus elastic sides that make pulling them on and off a breeze. Suede and leather-like materials also boost their flexibility while upping their comfort factor. And, any of the neutral shades will seamlessly fit right into your fall wardrobe. "

They're also fun to wear out on the weekends."""

The reviewer also noted that, ""When we showed up to St. Mark's Square in Venice, it was under a few inches of water. The platforms were up for walkways and people were trying to walk only on the edges of the square. It was nice to be able to just walk right through it with these boots. No lines for me and lots of people with wishful looks on their faces."" "
